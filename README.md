# Log Normal Distribution

This project explores the **Log-Normal Distribution** using Python, including its characteristics, applications, and visualization.  
It also demonstrates how to work with datasets, perform statistical analysis, and plot results.

## 📌 Project Overview
A **log-normal distribution** is a probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed.  
It is commonly used in:
- Financial modeling (e.g., stock prices)
- Environmental data (e.g., rainfall)
- Biological measurements (e.g., growth rates)

This project includes:
- Understanding the theory behind log-normal distribution
- Working with datasets in Python
- Generating plots and statistical measures
- Jupyter Notebook implementation

## 📂 Repository Structure
-Log normal distribution.ipynb # Main Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations

-income.csv # Sample dataset used for analysis
